## Introduction

This a Simple Landing page project that uses **JavaScript** to Dynamically build the navigation bar and update it whenever a new Section is created in the website.
I also added some coll features to it:

* The navigation bar gets hidden if the user is not scrolling, i used a smooth transition for hiding and showing to make it better.
* Added a scroll to top button that only is visible when the user scrolls past the top of the page.
* Made the navigation bar show which section is currently active.
